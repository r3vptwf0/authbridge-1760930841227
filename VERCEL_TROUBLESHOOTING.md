# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue

Build succeeded but deployment failed with:
```
An unexpected error happened when running this build. We have been notified of the problem. 
This may be a transient error. If the problem persists, please contact Vercel Support.
```

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

Your build completed successfully:
- ✓ Compiled successfully
- ✓ Prisma generated
- ✓ All 13 pages generated
- ✓ No TypeScript errors
- ✓ Linting passed

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. Transient Vercel Error (Most Likely)

**Action:** Simply retry the deployment
```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or push again to trigger auto-deploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy"
git push
```

### 2. Output Size Issue

Your build output is quite large. Check if this is the issue:

**Files to review:**
- `/wallet` route: 24.1 kB (largest)
- Total middleware: 27.1 kB

**Solution:** If Vercel complains about size:
1. Enable code splitting
2. Lazy load heavy components
3. Check bundle analyzer:
   ```bash
   npm install -D @next/bundle-analyzer
   ```

### 3. Environment Variables Missing

**Action:** Verify all required env vars are set in Vercel dashboard:

Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables

Required variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`

Optional (for Telegram):
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
- `INTERNAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**Important:** After adding env vars, redeploy.

### 4. Serverless Function Timeout

The error occurred during "Deploying outputs" phase, which could mean:
- Database connection timeout
- Prisma client generation issue
- Large function bundle

**Solution:** 
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure Prisma schema is valid

### 5. Region/Network Issue

The build ran in Portland (pdx1). Sometimes specific regions have issues.

**Solution:** 
1. Wait 5-10 minutes and retry
2. Try deploying from a different region (Vercel will auto-select)
3. Use Vercel CLI to force different region

## Recommended Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Verify Environment Variables

```bash
# Check if all required vars are set
vercel env ls
```

If missing, add them:
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
```

### Step 2: Clean Deploy

```bash
# Remove .vercel directory
rm -rf .vercel

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Check Vercel Logs

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on failed deployment
3. Check "Function Logs" and "Build Logs"
4. Look for specific error messages

### Step 4: Simplify Deployment (If Needed)

Create `vercel.json` to optimize:

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "prisma generate && next build",
  "devCommand": "next dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "regions": ["pdx1", "sfo1"],
  "functions": {
    "app/**/*.tsx": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Alternative - Try Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy with pre-built output
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

## Quick Fixes Checklist

- [ ] Retry deployment (wait 5 minutes first)
- [ ] Verify all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs for specific errors
- [ ] Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct and accessible from Vercel
- [ ] Try deploying from Vercel CLI instead of Git push
- [ ] Contact Vercel support if error persists (they were notified)

## Common Vercel Deployment Errors

### Error: "Serverless Function size exceeded"
**Solution:** 
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use dynamic imports
- Enable output file tracing

### Error: "Build exceeded maximum duration"
**Solution:**
- Upgrade Vercel plan
- Optimize build steps
- Remove heavy dependencies

### Error: "Environment variable not found"
**Solution:**
- Add missing env vars in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure vars are set for correct environment (Production/Preview)
- Redeploy after adding vars

## Vercel Configuration Check

Your current build config (from logs):
- ✅ Framework: Next.js 14.2.31
- ✅ Runtime: Bun 1.2.23
- ✅ Install: 380 packages
- ✅ Build time: ~16 seconds (good)
- ✅ Cache: Working (restored from previous)
- ❌ Deployment: Failed at "Deploying outputs" phase

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - This appears to be a transient Vercel infrastructure error
2. **Retry deployment** - Simply push again or click "Redeploy" in Vercel dashboard
3. **Check status** - Visit https://www.vercel-status.com/ for any ongoing issues
4. **If persists** - Contact Vercel Support with deployment ID

## Your Build is Healthy ✅

Your code and build are working perfectly. The error is on Vercel's deployment infrastructure, not your application. Simply retry the deployment.

**TL;DR:** Retry deployment in 5 minutes. Your build is fine, this is a Vercel infrastructure issue.
